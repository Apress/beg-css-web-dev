Beginning CSS Web Development
Simon Collison / 2006 / Apress
Accompanying source code and image files.

----------------------------------------------

Finding the code you need should be easy. Each chunk has the page number immediately above.

So, if you need code from Chapter 6, Page 117, open the "ch06-snippets.txt" file, and either scroll through the page numbers, or do a "Find" for either "Page 117" or just "117". Job is a good 'un.

Where relevant, full files mentioned in the chapters are included in the relevant folder.

-----------------------------------------------

Three image folders are included.

- The "images-ch16" folder contains all of the web files for the Case Study (Ch 16).
- The "images-ch16-psd" folder contains the Photoshop file for the Case Study (Ch16).
- The "images" folder features other images used in the book, archived in chapter folders.

-----------------------------------------------
